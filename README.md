My client, crafts waist beads, bracelets, necklaces, and hair accessories but struggles to manually track customer measurements, details, and sales, often losing data. She also wants customers to input their own details via a link. I propose a web-based tool using Python Flask and SQLite, featuring a customer-facing form for self-entry of names, contacts, and sizes, and a dashboard for her to manage profiles and log sales. This applies digital transformation by automating data collection and enhancing accessibility, built with free tools within the project timeline
